    <h3 class="ship-name">Lasting Damage</h3>
    <p>This ship first appeared in the book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_to_Windward">Look to Winward</a>—the ship is a <strong>General Systems Vehicle (GSV)</strong>. GSVs are mobile habitats and / or factory ships, they are the largest Culture ship type. They may be home to billions of people.</p>
    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> A GSV built for combat on the eve of the Idiran-Culture War. After it was destroyed in battle, a recorded copy of its mind-state was embodied in a new Mind and incorporated into another GSV of the same class. Its original Mind was later found to have survived the ship’s destruction, and was also incorporated into a new combat GSV.</p>
