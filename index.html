    <h1 class="post-title">Pick a Culture ship at random</h1>
    <p>I often use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series">Culture</a> ship names when having to identify random electronic / digital bits at work or homeâ€”iPhones, iPads, databases, directories, sometimes even methods or functions. This makes picking a name at random a little bit easier. It was also an excuse to teach myself how <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> uses collections and data files. Enjoy.</p>
