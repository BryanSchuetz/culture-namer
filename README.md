# Poole-Frameless

Just your basic project starter template for [Jekyll](#), using some sensible defaults from [Poole](#) and an adaptive grid from [Frameless](#).

### Includes some essential bits not available out of the box with Poole:

* Sass styles (Jekyll 2.0 supports Sass and CoffeScript out of the box, nuff said).
* Browser-Sync for auto reloading.
* [Prose](http://prose.io) support, for use with client site owners.
* Frameless Grid - because fluid layouts are the devil.
