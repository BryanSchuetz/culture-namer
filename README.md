# Poole-Frameless

Just your basic project starter template for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), using some sensible defaults from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and an adaptive grid from [Frameless](http://framelessgrid.com/).

### Includes essential bits and/or configuration not available out of the box:

* Sass styles (Jekyll 2.0 supports Sass and CoffeScript out of the box, good enough for me).
* Grunt - ['grunt-contrib-watch', 'grunt-shell'] for triggering "jekyll build", live-reload, asset optimization, etc.
* [Prose](http://prose.io) support, for use with client site owners.
* A Frameless Adaptive Grid - because fluid layouts are the devil.
* POW - for serving sites locally and to mobiles via [XIP.io](http://xip.io/)
