# Poole-Frameless

Just your basic project starter template for [Jekyll](#), using [Poole](#) and an adaptive grid from [Frameless](#).

### Adding a couple features over what's out of the box with Poole

* Moving styles to Sass - nuff said. (I've been using Jekyll 2.0 which supports Sass and coffeescript natively, so why not.)
* Browser-Sync - Refreshing the browser? What is this, 1994?
* [Prose](http://prose.io) support, for use with clients
