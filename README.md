# Poole-Frameless

Just your basic project starter template for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), using some sensible defaults from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and an adaptive grid from [Frameless](http://framelessgrid.com/).

### Includes essential bits and/or configuration not available out of the box:

* Sass styles (Jekyll 2.0 supports Sass and CoffeScript out of the box, good enough for me. **Now GH-Pages also rubs Jekyll 2+**)
* [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) and [Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake) for building sites locally for use with [Pow](http://pow.cx)
* [Prose](http://prose.io) support, for use with client site owners.
* A Frameless Adaptive Grid - because fluid layouts are the devil.
* [POW](http://pow.cx) - for serving sites locally and to mobiles via [XIP.io](http://xip.io/)
